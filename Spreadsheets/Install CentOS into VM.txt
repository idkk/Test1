Select the location of your installer image from disk (second option)

Page 2: Easy Install Information
Asks for "Full name" and passwords.
Sets up a normal user, and root, and they share the password.

Spliting the files seems like a good idea?

Login and attempt to set suitable security:-
   See : http://wiki.centos.org/HowTos/Network/SecuringSSH

   1) Use Strong Password/Usernames
      root  FunSp0nge - Console Login Only
      isds  H1ghEnergy
      agmw  ********    Capone Nil

   2) Disable Root Logins (other than on Console): In file /etc/ssh/sshd_config
     PermitRootLogin no
   ... and restart the sshd service
     service sshd restart

   3) Limited User Logins: In file /etc/ssh/sshd_config
   Only specified Users will be able to login via SSH
     AllowUsers agmw
   ... and restart the sshd service
     service sshd restart


Boot Single User:-
================
Press 'any key' at start of boot process
NB: If running in a VM you must 'click' to give the console input focus before you can press 'any key'.

Select the boot line and press 'a' to append to the end of the boot line. Add " single" to the end of the line and press RETURN.

Do whatever it is you wanted it in single user mode for
    eg Change /etc/hosts or /etc/fstab

To exit single user mode
    init 0 : to halt the system
    init 3 : to boot to text interface
    init 5 : to boot to graphical interface
    init 6 : to reboot


Change Hostname:-
===============
Instructions from http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/centos-hostname-change
    Step 1:-
        As root, edit the following file ...
            # vi /etc/sysconfig/network
        Modify the "HOSTNAME=.." value ...

    Step 2:-
        As root, edit the hosts file ...
            # vi /etc/hosts
        Add/change IP address to use new name(s)

    Step 3:-
        Run 'hostname' as root ...
            # hostname <new hostname>

    Step 4:-
        Restart networking, as root run ...
            # /etc/init.d/network restart

   Using http://www.broexperts.com/2013/03/how-to-setup-static-ip-in-centos-6-3/

   1) Update /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0
     Dynamic                         Static
    =========                       ========

   2) Network Manager
       # service NetworkManager stop
       # chkconfig NetworkManager off

   3) Assign gateway IP address
       Edit /etc/sysconfig/network
           NETWORKING=yes
           HOSTNAME=lx.broexperts.com
           GATEWAY=192.168.1.100

   4) Assign DNS server ip address
       Edit /etc/resolv.conf
           nameserver 192.168.1.200

   5) Restart network service
       # service network restart


Add New Disk:-
==============
If you've added a new disk to the server (or new virtual disk to a VM server)
you need to format it and build a partition table.

    Add New Disks
    -------------
    Under ESXi I added new storages using the Isilon.

    Show New Disks
    --------------
    If you look in /dev you should see the new disks you've added...
        # ls -l /dev/sd*
        brw-rw---- 1 root disk 8,  0 Nov 11 11:41 /dev/sda
        brw-rw---- 1 root disk 8,  1 Nov 11 11:41 /dev/sda1
        brw-rw---- 1 root disk 8,  2 Nov 11 11:41 /dev/sda2
        brw-rw---- 1 root disk 8,  3 Nov 11 11:41 /dev/sda3
        brw-rw---- 1 root disk 8, 16 Nov 11 11:41 /dev/sdb
        brw-rw---- 1 root disk 8, 17 Nov 11 11:41 /dev/sdb1
        brw-rw---- 1 root disk 8, 32 Nov 11 13:53 /dev/sdc      - New Disk
        brw-rw---- 1 root disk 8, 48 Nov 11 14:00 /dev/sdd      - New Disk
        brw-rw---- 1 root disk 8, 64 Nov 11 11:41 /dev/sde      - New Disk
        brw-rw---- 1 root disk 8, 80 Nov 11 11:41 /dev/sdf      - New Disk

    In this example I added four new disks.
    

    Create a Partition Table
    ------------------------
    Assuming the new device is called /dev/sdn, as root, 

        # fdisk /dev/sdn

    This enters a command line driven tool for building the partition table.
    Select the following options:-
        n<RETURN>  : New Partition
        p<RETURN>  : and it's a Primary Partition
        1<RETURN>  : Use Partition No. 1 (one)
        <RETURN>   : take the default First cylinder (1)
        <RETURN>   : take the default Last cylinder (267349 in my case)
        w<RETURN>  : Write new partition to disk and exit

    Looking again at the devices in /dev you will now notice there are some new 
    files representing the new Partitions you just made:-
        ...
        brw-rw---- 1 root disk 8, 32 Nov 11 13:53 /dev/sdc       - Device
        brw-rw---- 1 root disk 8, 32 Nov 11 13:53 /dev/sdc1      - Parition 1
        brw-rw---- 1 root disk 8, 48 Nov 11 14:00 /dev/sdd
        brw-rw---- 1 root disk 8, 32 Nov 11 13:53 /dev/sdd1
        brw-rw---- 1 root disk 8, 64 Nov 11 11:41 /dev/sde
        brw-rw---- 1 root disk 8, 32 Nov 11 13:53 /dev/sde1
        brw-rw---- 1 root disk 8, 80 Nov 11 11:41 /dev/sdf
        brw-rw---- 1 root disk 8, 32 Nov 11 13:53 /dev/sdf1


    Format Hard Disk
    ----------------
    Using the newly created devices (eg /dev/sdc1), format each partition. In our
    case we've only created one partition per device :-

        # mke2fs /dev/sdc1


    Update /etc/fstab
    -----------------
    Firstly, we need to make a mount point for each partition to be mounted

        # mkdir /<mount point>

    Then we edit /etc/fstab to include the new partition(s)

        # vi /etc/fstab

    Add a suitable new line, for example ...

        /dev/sdc1    <mount point>   ext3   defaults   1 2

    Then mount the new devices:-

        # mount -a

    And finally check they've mounted OK ...

        # df -H
