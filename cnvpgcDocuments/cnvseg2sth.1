Program
.Nm
takes a standard SEG-Y file and converts it into the format required for loading
into StorHouse. The output file may (optionally) be "chunked",
.\" converted between different endianicities (big-endian / little-endian),
and converted in floating-point format (IBM and IEEE).

A list of flags and their descriptions:
.Bl -tag -width -indent  \" Begins a tagged list 
.It Fl i               \" Each item preceded by .It macro
The name of the input file for
.Nm
.It Fl o
The name of the output file for
.Nm
Note that this file, if it already exists, will by default be overwritten,
unless the
.Sy -R
.Sy \&No
parameter is also specified.
.It Fl D
The name of the output directory. This is a prefix to the name of the output
file, and if this is actually a directory then its last character must be a
slash.
.It Fl s
The File Sequence Number. This is used....
.It Fl b c
Specify the chuncking size for the output file. If not specified then the
default value is zero, which indicates that all samples (for each point) are
in a single chunk. If the value is other than zero, then it indicates the
maximum number of samples that may be written to a single chunk.
The maximum size of a chunk (number of samples) for 4-byte samples is
.Sy 8175
, for 2-byte samples
.Sy 16350
, and for 1-byte samples
.Sy 32700
.It Fl l
The length of the output filename. This is used....
.It Fl p
The displacement of a field which is to be duplicated at the start of the
output Trace Header record. The length of this field is specified by the
following
.Sy -L
parameter. At most 16 of these fields may be specified.
.It Fl L
The length, in characters (bytes) of the preceding
.Sy -p
field.
If not specified, the length is 4.
.It Fl F
The floating point format of the output. The valid values are
.Sy I
for IBM floating point, and
.Sy E
for IEEE floating point. By default no floating point conversion will
take place.
.It Fl R
Is this program permitted to overwrite pre-existing files with its output?
The default is YES (overwriting is permitted). The valid specifications are
YES and NO.
.It Fl m
The valid values are YES and NO, indicating whether the "Cristina's field" is
to be written to the output Trace Header records.....
.It Fl j
If specified, then extra File Header records in the input will not be copied
to the output. This is the default, and in the current version of
.Nm
there is no alternative specification.
.It Fl d
Dimensionalty. This parameter is not currently suppoerted.
.It Fl t T
This parameter is not for production, and turns on trace (debug) flags.
.It Fl 0 1 2 3
None of these flags are currently supported. The set the number of output
files that will be generated by the program
.Nm
By default parameter
.Sy -3
is set, indicating that all the three streams of output (File Header, Trace Header
and Trace Data) go into one file.
.It Fl v
Display the version number (and compile and edit dates) of program
