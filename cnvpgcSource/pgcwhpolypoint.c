 ** Function : SetPointsAngle()

 ** Arguments: Ptr to 'corner' point
 ** Returns  : Angle
 ** Notes    : We have to find out what the angle is between lines AB and BC,
 **            when what we know are the coordinates of A, B and C … (xa, ya,),
 **            (xb, yb) and (xc, yc). And we have to do this without using the
 **            tan function, as tangents are unfriendly numbers as we approach
 **            90° or π/2 and multiples thereof.
 **            This would be a lot easier if (xa, ya,) were (0, 0) [that is,
 **            point A is the origin] and line AB lay on the X axis, so that
 **            point B had coordinates (0, y´b)
 **            This give point C new coordinates (x´c, y´c).
 **            So some of this is like the formulae used in the elastic band
 **            algorithm – movement of origin [to A at (xa, ya,)] and rotation
 **            of axes [to make AB lie on the X axis].

	 **   C is above the axis and to the left of B:
	 **     the angle is greater than 90° (π/2) and is negative.
	 ** So what we do is compute the angle Ang from acos(Cabc) and then (for the
	 ** four quadrants):    below right: T = Ang
	 **                     above right: T = - Ang
